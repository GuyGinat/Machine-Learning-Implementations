# Machine-Learning-Implementations
Implementations of machine learning algorithems including data

Machine learning algorithems included in this repo:
1. Linear Regression - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression
2. Decision Tree - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning
3. Knn - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm

Data for these implementations is provided within the folder of each algorithm
In order to use this code it is neccesery to install weka for java - https://sourceforge.net/projects/weka/
